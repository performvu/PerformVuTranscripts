  <p>Asia Stewart: Welcome to Open Studios - a podcast brought to you by PerformVu - the digital home for video art, performance art, dance film, art film, and so much more.</p>
  <p>If you didn’t already know, PerformVu is a streaming platform showcasing video works from top artists, galleries, and museums around the world.</p>
  <p>If you’re enjoying listening to these conversations and want to support artists directly, why not check out the platform for yourself?</p>
  <p>For those who are new to the podcast, my name is Asia Stewart and I am a performance artist and the Founding Artistic Director of PerformVu. I’ll also be your host.</p>
  <p>In every episode, I’ll be sitting down with a different artist to take a virtual step inside their studio to learn more about their practice and motivations.</p>
  <p>We’re currently in between seasons here at Open Studios, but there’s more to come later this summer.</p>
  <p>We have a special episode for you today - Jemila MacEwan, an interdisciplinary artist known for their astounding earthworks, joins me in a two-part conversation on their upcoming durational performance Seed Meditation.</p>
  <p>MacEwan’s practice is grounded in patience. They work with the land and earth slowly, often over long periods of time, to make evident the changes happening within landscapes and environments.</p>
  <p>For example, MacEwan’s Seed Meditation involves them sitting in Washington Square Park across 10 days from Friday, April 12th to Sunday, April 21st. During that time MacEwan will hold a seed in their hands as it germinates.</p>
  <p>In this episode, recorded a few weeks before Jemila’s performance, you’ll hear us wonder how the performance will unfold.</p>
  <p>In a few weeks, Jemila and I will be back to reflect on Seed Meditation and all of the wonders that are borne out of it. Let’s go to the show!</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Welcome, Jemila. Thank you for coming on to the podcast. How are you feeling today?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: It's, you know, we're all riding this very bumpy spring. So, you know, these kind of false starts that we get to spring. Today, it's in between cold and warm, but yeah, generally feeling good. Now that we're kind of coming out of winter.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And what are some of your hopes for this season, for spring, for yourself?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: My hope right now is a greater tolerance overall that people have. Both for their own inner conflict and their ability to recognize their inner conflict, but also to recognize that even when others appear certain, that they are also in conflict and that we can kind of be there for each other. And I think that's very important as, you know, things globally come to a head, that we have greater tolerance for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And I guess as we'll discuss in this episode, so much of what you're offering through Seed Meditation is communion as well. As this space for people to come together and be with you as you're standing in Washington Square Park in silence and just have that moment of– hopefully– peace and introspection together.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: I always revel when I can make a piece or a performance that is very season specific like this, where I can really actually feel supported by the greater process that is happening in nature, supporting me within my own process and kind of like, resting back on that.And this piece is very much about showing people that they can rest back in that.</p>
  <p>And I think spring is, in particular, a season that can cause a lot of anxiety and friction for people. It's a multiplicity kind of season where you're both in the, that sleepy introverted state of winter that has been very heavy. And you know, cracking open into spring, into summer can be very emotional: in really positive energetic ways, but then sometimes kind of harnessing that energy or even finding stillness when things are percolating is tough.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah, absolutely. Because it's that time of emergence or even that pre-chorus to the emergence. As you were speaking, I was thinking of a bird, sort of a baby bird, like cracking out of its shell and almost the sort of thrust or the sort of push coming up against the edge of the shell and like the first moments of breaking through.</p>
  <p>And I think so much of spring and this moment that we're in is that.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: Yeah. And I mean, I think that actually really speaks to the type of anxiety that people experience. And it was once put to me that “anxiety is the sensation of discomfort that one feels because there is a need to break through.”</p>
  <p>And so actually anxiety is really rooted to the state of birth. It gives you the necessary momentum to make a change, to push through a state of, you know, coming into life, coming into being that is also very inextricably linked to the fear of death. I think on a visceral level that is the inner turmoil that happens in spring.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: What you said about the anxiety around death, so much of that lives in this season too.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: Yes. Yes. In both seasons. And they are really interesting in terms of their energies because spring is the fear of death that comes from life. So it's actually like, it's a little bit more intense in a way. Whereas I think fall is about this kind of inevitability or settling of death.</p>
  <p>You know, it's like there is a release or a relief that happens at least for me in the fall. It's the calm season. But both [fall and spring] actually come with tremendous creative energy and inspiration for me. They are the two seasons that I get the most creative inspiration from.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah. Wow. I guess so much of our conversation also perfectly relates, of course, to Seed Meditation. If you could share a little bit more about Seed Meditation with listeners?</p>
  <p>I do know that next month in April, you will be in Washington Square Park, present in the park, holding a seed in your palm and letting it germinate across those 10 days, 13 hours each day. I'd love to hear more about the piece and about how you're feeling about it now, you know, looking towards next month.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: Yeah so, those are the general conditions of the work. I will be in different locations within the park as well.</p>
  <p>I'll be sitting in seated meditation and contemplation from sunrise to sunset. So really following that circadian rhythm as well, which is really rooted in our biology actually– our molecules and our genes have the circadian rhythm recorded within them. And so does the seed. And, in this way, you know, us and plants, we're evolutionary siblings, you know, so we share common bacterial ancestors.</p>
  <p>So, in this way, I'm turning to the seed as a kind of a guru, as a teacher, as a teacher that can teach me the most simple patience of what it is to let that unfolding of life happen at the pace that it happens. And just being with that.</p>
  <p>And for me, a lot of my ideas start out like incredibly simple like that, because I think that once I can find something that is a simple enough container and do that and follow that idea to the most expansive way that I can– so really to sit and observe that process for 10 days– allows me to have all of this time in contemplation. I trust very much that because I've had many other kinds of interspecies or non-human teachers in the past that there is a great deal to learn from it.</p>
  <p>For anyone that knows my practice, or if you don't know my practice, I'm a performance artist, but I'm also a land artist. And quite often when you're making earthworks, there is firstly a legacy of earthworks being gigantic. And that is actually because when you are in a huge expansive landscape, there is a sense that the work that you do has to be in scale to the space that you're working in. And I've always had this question about what, how would one make an earthwork in New York?</p>
  <p>We do have a legacy of that in for instance, Agnes Denes’ Wheatfield, which is now very well known. And that was possible at that time because that space was available. And [there is] less and less opportunity to respond in a large space in New York. And so I actually thought about, okay–  I'm always like, how can I undo the habits of my thinking or my assumptions?</p>
  <p>And in this case, it was kind of like, what if the earthwork was tiny, you know, what if it was minuscule and is it still an earthwork? And because my earthworks are also always performances, they're always about time and they're always about being present to the process, I felt like there was this real potential in that.</p>
  <p>And so I decided that Washington Square Park was going to be the site. And in part that's because I find Washington Square Park is an inspiring location to me. I think a lot of New Yorkers relate to Washington Square Park in this way, but it feels like it's one of the few places in New York where you really watch your fellow New Yorkers and tourists and whoever, they go to the park and they really perform themselves. They let their guards down. You know, people get high in the park, they hook up, they break up. There's skaters. There's all the students that are angsty. There's the chess players. This park holds all these multitudes.</p>
  <p>And then as someone that thinks about space and how spaces can connect us to or orient us to a kind of an ecological sense, the design of that park has this fountain at its heart, you know, this gush of water at its heart. And from there you have all of these kinds of arteries of pathways that thread through the park. And it has this really nice bodily symmetry. And so I think actually even the design of the park is one of the reasons that it is able to hold so much of people's emotional realities and emotional truths.</p>
  <p>And, you know, the other thing about Washington Square Park is it has this really rich history of being a location in which people meet for protest. It has a long history…all kinds of performance artists and performers go there.</p>
  <p>But this idea of protest has been something that has sat with me as an environmental artist for a long time. And my own sort of personal brand of activism is not rooted in confrontation. It's very much rooted in how to re-ground, how to de-escalate, how to actually have people hold the whole reality of their emotional selves and the emotional selves of others and then expand out into the ecology of the place they're in.</p>
  <p>And, you know, really, I've always thought the best activism is actually the activism that opens hearts and helps people to feel whole and supported because activism as well can really drain one.</p>
  <p>So this piece, I'm also really thinking about it in the history of protest, of peaceful protest. And instead of protesting against, I'm protesting for. And it's a protest in advocacy for life, in advocacy for patience, like a realistic understanding of what living processes are: how long they take, how fragile they are. And that we can take our time. You know, we can seize our time.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And I'm thinking about the importance of location to this performance, to you, and particularly your comments around how conducive and important it is to have access to space to produce land art or environmental art. And one of the sad realities here in New York City is that there are few remaining public spaces that can be accessed for free. And Washington Square Park is one of those spaces.</p>
  <p>And it's really shocking! So, access to parks, green space, the coast, water, so much of that is privatized now and owned by companies and corporations and buildings. So everyday people can't relish in those spaces. You know, it should just be there and be open and be accessible instead of a certain privilege for a few.</p>
  <p>So, I think it's really wonderful that you are centering so much of the history of what Washington Square Park has offered to the city and to its inhabitants: both human and non-human beings that exist within that space.</p>
  <p>Something that I was actually thinking about this morning before our conversation is that you are providing a temporary home for the seed as it germinates in your hand. And although the performance may ostensibly look simple, it's actually quite complex in that life is taking shape and form with you and with the others who participate and witness [the performance].</p>
  <p>How would you feel– and you can't really anticipate what your feelings will be with the performance– but how much of the performance do you think is centered around that germination and perhaps the product of germination and that life actually taking shape? And how would you feel if, over the course of those 10 days, the seed does not survive and sprout life?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: This has definitely been a concern. I'm doing a fair bit of work to try to ensure the success of the seed that I'm working with. You know, if you work with a newer seed, a younger seed, that's only a year old, let's say, a high quality seed, you're more likely to get germination to happen.</p>
  <p>I don't know if anyone has bought kind of like cheap seeds from a hardware store that doesn't turn its stock over and like has had no results. It's probably just that those seeds are really old.</p>
  <p>There is no guaranteed success. And there is a certain degree to which I approach these projects with a kind of faith and once any of these performances begin, it's always a process of accepting and receiving the lessons of however things unfold.</p>
  <p>There's still a kind of pathos or telos to even just holding a seed that maybe had the potential for life and didn't grow. And you know, some people approach that in a way that produces more anxiety as though like or, you know, a superstitious kind of thing with whether things live or die.</p>
  <p>Whereas I don't see–  there isn't, to me, a huge difference in [that]. You know– yes, there's a massive difference between whether something lives or if it does not live. And yet to contemplate the potential for life is still– is the meeting place of those two potentialities. And this is something that we contend with all the time.</p>
  <p>But yeah, I think also just maybe sitting with the hope of something potentially germinating. But I would be lying if I said I wasn't anxious about this. It's definitely a concern. And yet when things are concerns of mine, but out of my hands…You know, like also the presence of rain. That’s out of my hands. I can prepare for it. I can do my best, but if it's pouring with rain, no matter how much rain coverage I give myself, [I will get wet.] Washington Square Park has relatively good drainage, but, you know, a lot of water is going to pour, and I will get wet.</p>
  <p>And so, it's just, to me, it's about greeting each eventuality with the, with the right attitude. And I think when you approach these things with the correct attitude, you still get to the place you're going.</p>
  <p>I am hopeful for an unfolding of that process of germination. Cause when you do grow plants from seed, it always feels like a miracle that it's happened, you know, that the seed has germinated.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Yeah, I feel a sense of wonder. I'm surrounded by a few plants in the room that I'm in right now. And even when they develop a new leaf, it just feels so momentous and so miraculous.</p>
  <p>There is a multiplicity of variables in play during those 10 days and so much that's out of your hands and out of anyone's hands. And it's just what will be.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: It's like the point of it, you know. In all of these works, the best lessons for me actually come from adversity. It always comes from me having to let go of my control, you know, and just sit and go: “okay, what am I learning here? What's happening?”</p>
  <p>But, you know, I'm also not out there to suffer. So I don't treat adversity as something that I'm like, “okay, well I just have to stoically be in this.” 'Cause that's also another kind of control. I'm also always like, “Well, how do I take care of myself in this, you know?”</p>
  <p>So for instance, another, my longest durational work, Human Meteorite, where I was digging every day for 10 days. On Day 10, I hit physical limits that prevented me from digging. So, I was digging every single day and that was the plan. But on that particular day, I was like, well, I have to take care of myself. So, I will dig, but it's almost– at that point it becomes ceremonial, you know.</p>
  <p>So, I'm sure that actually there will be things like that, that I haven't fully anticipated where I hit my limits in this. All kinds of different limits. You know, emotional limits, physical limits, psychological limits, and then I'm going to have to decide: how do I take care of myself right now, knowing that I've hit a limit?</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Absolutely. And I'm also reminded too, that you've opened up, so generously, this performance and this experience to members of your community.</p>
  <p>So people have the opportunity each day for an hour at a time to join you in meditation and support you in whatever way you need. What also is really beautiful is that in the way that you've structured the performance, each day you've associated with a different theme and color. And so there are these external resources and people who will be there, you know, with you along this journey.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: So for six of the 13 hours, I have invited people that are in my life that I have a relationship [with] around support. So either I supported them, they supported me, or we mutually received support from another, you know, maybe an organization, maybe another person. But that support is actually a feature of our relationship. And I've invited them to support me in this process.</p>
  <p>And yeah, that has been one of the ways where I am thinking about my emotional limits and because this is very much rooted in… at its heart, it's about joy and it's about love. And so yeah, I was like, actually to open this up, to have people sit with me, supporting me as I'm supporting the seed, [and] we're all being supported by Washington Square Park. And then inversely, the seed is supporting us all!</p>
  <p>And that was, you know, part of that was a kind of a practical consideration of, of my survival [through the performance]. But actually many years ago when I was speaking to this wonderful artist, Laura Anderson Barbata, who's a Mexican-American artist. She pointed out to me in my work that when I ask people to support me, when I'm vulnerable as a performer and I ask the audience to support me, that that is a gift to them.</p>
  <p>That really cracked something open for me where I realize now that you know, asking for support is actually a generous act sometimes, you know, if you approach it with generosity. Because you also remind people that you're there to support them, you know? It's a reminder that you're in a reciprocal relationship.</p>
  <p>And so with the colors, each day I'll be wearing a different color. So, the order is black, brown, blue, green, pink, purple, yellow, orange, red, and then the final day I'll be wearing white. And each of those colors is emblematic of a particular element, elemental force, material force, or element of nature I guess, that provides the conditions that allow for life.</p>
  <p>So, for instance– like, while we're on the topic of support– the second day where I'm wearing brown, the image that is associated with brown is that of soil. So, it's the earth that allows that gestation to occur. It's also the place of turning over the mineral and the organic into one body.</p>
  <p>And so it's this very mysterious process, right? It is very unformed. And so I've associated that with the spiritual transformation of releasing doubt. You know, I think we experience doubt the most when we're in that state of mysterious churning, when there's very little certainty about what's going to arise.</p>
  <p>But to approach our doubt with a trust actually opens us up or makes us available to a condition of divine love that I would define as support. And so each of these different days corresponds to a different aspect of divine love.</p>
  <p>So, you know, it's like growth and support and grace and you know– I can't rattle them all off– but I've also written about each of these colors: what they represent and what is the particular detail of that process of germination we're performing that day.</p>
  <p>So each day is a kind of a detail of part of a greater process of opening oneself up or germinating into a state of being available to divine love. And so the book is going to be gifted to each person that sits with me; [they] will receive 10 seeds [and] a dish.</p>
  <p>So actually, while I'm germinating the seed– I should say this ‘cause people imagine that I will just have it sitting in the palm of my hand which I tried and it's very difficult to hold enough water in your palm– so, I actually have a little dish that I will be holding that germinates the seed. And so, for each of the participants, I will be gifting a dish, 10 seeds, and this small modest book that explains the whole process.</p>
  <p>Because it's also something that I realized is a practice that I could pass on to others, you know? They don't have to do it in such an extreme way as I'm doing it, but even just giving yourself five minutes to attend to and notice the transformation of a seed evolving each day and checking in with these different processes each day would be enough, I think.</p>
  <p>But yeah, it was also this thing of going, okay, like I know everything that a seed evokes. It cracks open all these things to me. It makes me think of water, the sun, like the incredible energy of the sun. You know, soil and the beauty of blossoms and spring and a wound and healing … Like, it makes me think of all of these things. And this was a way of kind of showing or opening out, like, what is that interior imagination for me, or was that interior ecological understanding for me… where the ecological and the spiritual journey are always so inextricably linked.</p>
  <p>And that's been a joy to put together because it actually has allowed me to clarify a lot of the things that I just kind of take for granted all the time and be able to communicate them.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: It's such a beautiful offering to bestow. I'm very much looking forward to participating. As you're sitting with the seed, which will be nestled inside the bowl…being able to watch that process [will be incredible.] Because again, if I think about even the room that I'm in… I notice the stages, but I never see that process of emergence, of the start of something. And I think to facilitate life for another being–  it's a really, really special thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: Yeah. I should add as well that anyone that's a passerby is welcome to come and sit with me. Anyone can sit with me! The only thing that I ask is that you also observe noble silence during that time. So, you know, like if you can put your phone away, you know, all of that.</p>
  <p>There will be a little meditation bench that anyone is welcome to come and sit on. If one of the other supporters comes, just if you can…make way for them to take that seat.</p>
  <p>And then on top of that, I will be making the texts, like a PDF of the book, available because I also don't really believe in gatekeeping any of this information. I don't think actually any of this really belongs to me. It's something that I feel fortunate that has come through me, but I also understand that anything that comes through you as an artist or however you define yourself, it's really your responsibility to give it.</p>
  <p>And I mean, I also am just always in awe of the gift of the technology that exists within life. I mean, technology is this– I kind of like to unroot technology as a word from human beings and like put it back into these ingenious evolutions that happened on our planet, you know, this evolution of a protozoic, a new eukaryotic life, I'm just, I'm just always so in love with it, you know. And my spiritual path has always been intertwined with that. And to give away a kind of ecological spiritual approach– I think a lot of people are looking for that right now.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Absolutely. And that sense of rootedness!</p>
  <p>It’s been a long time since I've sat in a biology class. But I'm also imagining that the seed, if I'm remembering correctly, provides so much of what would become the food for the plant. And I'm also imagining that as the plant grows upwards or outwards, the bottom of the seed, if I can call it that, becomes the roots at some point. And so it's also nice to be like, in that and with that.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: You have the seed and it's like, it bursts open first. It puts its little root down and then it cracks open and opens its leaves. But yeah, the seed itself is its form of nourishment until the leaves can start photosynthesizing and pulling energy from the sun. But yeah, they are this amazing little packet.</p>
  <p>And I have a poem that I wrote for a piece that I made called Breathing Rock that really talks about this connection between geology and ecology. And the first line of that is, or the first couple of lines of that is: “time germinates from a seed, a seed that eats its own body.” And I think there is actually this really wonderful kind of sense of justice for me in the consumptive process that just is built in, like hardwired, built into living things.</p>
  <p>And so I'm also often looking to plants and things and, you know, and also fungi– like anyone that knows me, I like, have a lot of large projects around fungi– what I'm looking to be taught often is like how to be sufficient and resilient and how to be and have enough– and really it's like back to that thing of like how to let go of all of that doubt and actually trust that what is built into me and built into this world is able to hold and support me.</p>
  <p>And you know, and I think that is a big anxiety for us right now as a species that is recognizing its over-consumptive behaviors. And we collectively seem to be not going towards a trend of less consumption. But also I, as an individual, am fairly powerless with that. However, I don't think that that is an opt out for not addressing it. You know, I think actually just staying with it, reminding ourselves that that is the case. Even just calming down will make you consume less, you know, so there's this sort of calm. There's this, there's a kind of just sensibility in it, you know, honestly. I think the word sensible is underrated [laughs]. I think nature is so sensible.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: That word, you said enough, like that our environment, ourselves, that we can be enough and we don't need to seek affirmation from trinkets and objects outside of ourselves, that ourselves, our communities, that we can be enough for each other and provide each other with the resources that we need to survive.</p>
  <p>The other thing that I'm really imagining with the seed and the sort of emergence of a seed and transition into becoming a young plant is what you said that was so beautiful about: the seed eating itself, and the idea that we also, like, shed an earlier part or iteration of ourself to become something else, and that that is part of the conditions of any transformation. That there is this loss of a previous state and development into something else.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: Yeah, I mean, loss is something I think about a lot, and that's also something that I'm like– when something is lost, or you know, grief, right? The day that I'll be wearing purple, the theme is grief. And grief is very rooted in loss.</p>
  <p>And I've been going through my own process of grieving this winter actually, and sense of loss and I've come around actually to thinking about it as actually just returning back to the soil. It's not really– it is changed, but it's enriched. And I think this is the process of maturation, right? It's like– maturing is about kind of allowing these forms to break down, to be re-digested.</p>
  <p>And you know, you do eat your own body, you do eat your own self and it nourishes you, those past selves nourish you. And so they're in you. They don't really go away, but they're very much part of why and who you are now. So, yeah, they're still with you, but they are changed.</p>
  <p>I am wondering about how I apply that to thinking about where we are globally, ecologically. So that's a question I have no answers for right now, but it's something that– philosophically that’s what I'm thinking about.</p>
  <p>Always when I'm thinking about the big questions, I'm understanding it from the perspective of like, what can I witness in my own body? What can I really see? What can I learn from my own emotional transformations and you know, the process of cracking open, dissolving, grieving, crying, raging, laughing, you know? It’s all in there. And the inevitability of suffering and but kind of greeting suffering as holding a lot of potential.</p>
  <p>The gift of suffering is that it grants you so much insight, so much clarity. There's just like all these– I feel like suffering is just scattered with jewels, you know, if you, if you can tolerate it. But also that doesn't make the suffering any less real.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Your comments make me think about– something else I also probably learned in middle school science class– the law that matter cannot be created or destroyed, it simply changes form. And so much of what we've been sharing and speaking about with respect to life and birth and death and returning to the soil and what emerges from the soil reminds me of that idea.</p>
  <p>And what I'm so excited about with this performance and with your offerings is that it may encourage people to listen to the wisdom that's being shared by the seed that's in your hand. Being able to apply those processes of life making and building and imagining alternative ways of being and apply that to themselves, even in a small way.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Jemila MacEwan: One of the gifts that people take from it is just the sheer power of quiet observation. It's miraculous.</p>
  <p>You know, even think about geological processes, which– some of them happen at paces where we just get to view a nanosecond of this whole thing, but recorded in the body of the rock is this memory of this process. Even that: like just sitting there and looking at a rock, which is like moving, you know, transforming incredibly slowly to the point where we can't even see it transforming, but trusting that it's transforming.</p>
  <p>And actually what you said about matter, I remember hearing that and finding it immensely comforting. I was like, that's just so reassuring to know. And I think the reason that's reassuring is it actually allows us to let go of our egos, right? The ego responds in this way that it so urgently needs to kind of preserve itself. But this reminder that that doesn't mean preserving oneself infinitely, that the ego itself is a temporary moment in a kind of survival.</p>

  <p>Asia Stewart: I could honestly talk to you forever [laughs], but I know it is a Friday, you have the rest of your afternoon and evening, and you're also still in the process of preparing for Seed Meditation. So I think we should begin to close, but before we do so, is there anything else you'd like to share in this moment, in this period, before the performance begins?</p>

  <p>Jemila MacEwan: I guess what I would love to just say is like, I'm incredibly grateful for the support of PerformVu and the inclusion of this platform.</p>
  <p>And I mean, even the ethos of PerformVu feels so aligned with everything we've even been talking about, right. Of finding this way of generating support that is enough. I think for performance artists in particular, we often operate unfunded.</p>
  <p>It's one of the hardest art media– I've heard you can sell performance. I've never worked out how! [laughs] Beyond, you know, ticket sales for things. But performance art itself is often self funded and this project is no different to that.</p>
  <p>And PerformVu is the first time I've seen anyone find a way to firstly, make it easy for people that want to support artists to financially support them. And then also for artists to collectively share their work to a remote audience.</p>
  <p>I'm always trying to figure out how to do that. And, you know, I've tried everything. You know, when I did Human Meteorite, I was doing live broadcasts every day. But there is this kind of way that that platform is now much trickier for all kinds of artists and we're all still on there, we're doing our best but actually having something like PerformVu where you can see the art, it's not full of ads. And people can really find the work– that's really special.</p>
  <p>And then, you know, what I've been noticing is the way that now you're creating this– you're creating a community through it. So sometimes it can be hard for performance artists even to find each other.</p>
  <p>So I just wanted to say thank you and thank you for your thoughtful questions. I always consider conversation a gift. I think of conversation as one of my favorite creative forms because there's not so much pressure in it, but we get to grow and share ideas. And based on the questions you ask me, I think about things differently and they're always a wonderful record of a moment in time.</p>

  <p>Asia Stewart: Yes, it's funny thinking about corresponding with our future selves and the experience that we'll have in a few weeks listening back on this and also building on it.</p>
  <p>But thank you so much for your comments on PerformVu. I think this entire experience has just been building and working with the community and finding ways of establishing support. and letting the community be enough.</p>
  <p>Well, thank you so much for your time today, Jemila, and I'm excited to reconvene in April!</p>
