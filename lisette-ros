  Asia Stewart: Welcome to Open Studios, a podcast brought to you by PerformVu, the digital home for experimental performance. My name is Asia Stewart. I'm a performance artist and the Founding Artistic Director of PerformVu, and I'll also be your host. In every episode, I'll be sitting down with a different artist to take a virtual step inside their studio to learn more about their practice and motivations.
</div>

<div class="host">
  And in this episode, I have the pleasure of speaking with Lisette Ros.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: Lisette investigates daily conventions and quotidian behaviors. She approaches her performances as experiments or opportunities to research and collect data about her body, all in the attempt to better understand her fluid queer identity and consider the question, “who is she in the midst of it all?”
</div>

<div class="guest">
  She embraces discomfort and vulnerability, particularly in durational works that span multiple hours or even days. Lisette is continually familiarizing herself with her flesh, blood, and breath, turning everyday actions into extraordinary spectacles.
</div>

<div class="host">
  I am so, so excited for this conversation. Welcome Lisette.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: Thank you. Wow.
</div>

<div class="host">
  Asia Stewart: I think I want to begin our conversation with a question about environment and place. So, I read in a 2023 interview with Metal Magazine, you said or you mentioned how important it is for you to familiarize yourself with the location where you'll be performing. And you said, 
  “I need to get a sense of the energy there, the materials used, the inter-architecture, and find a connection between the location, and most importantly, the concept itself. Therefore, I always need to bond with the place, location, or space in advance, although I never rehearse or choreograph a performance piece. I devise a system of conditions for the work and the live performance. I must adhere to these conditions as an artist at all times.”
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: Yeah, I like this question to start with because a lot of times, most of the time, people are not really focused on that, but more on the performative or the performance or the bodily part. But for me personally, research for a piece starts in the need to be bonding with a certain location. That can be either in a different country or city or just a different place in your own familiar neighborhood. I mean it literally has to do with bonding with the space or with the behavior that is common at that space, in that space, at that location, and therefore I would like to be there physically.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Let's consider it most of the time possible for me to be there physically. And I touch, I feel, I smell, I lick, I, yeah, try to really bond with the walls, the floor, the material that is already there. It doesn't matter if we're now talking about an inside or an outside space or location.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And of course, I like to observe if there are other people around, or other native inhabitants or animals. I tend to be there as often as possible to observe, but initially it's just very broad and also a certain timing is connected to certain spaces and the behavior that is connected with it.
</div>

<div class="host">
  Asia Stewart: It also makes me think of instances where you've performed the same work multiple times in different locations. So, this comes to mind for maybe Reframing Conventions where, you perform that in a variety of very distinct spaces. So, outdoors, I think, in a field in Amsterdam South. Then you also perform that work in the Red Light District, and then also in a hotel space where, because of the pandemic, there was no live audience with you physically in the space, but the performance was live streamed.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Lisette Ros: That is also a very special work to me because it's my first official piece ever as an artist and it's in the title Reframing Conventions.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  Actually, this 2023 is the year that is its 10 year anniversary. So it's pretty cool. I performed this piece lots of times. Initially it derived from my research into the plain office space. Uh, and with plain, I meant really like the… let's say the eighties American box [cubical] offices. That's where my research started.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And then growing out of it, obviously I live in the Netherlands. So, here it got slightly different, but let's say plain office space. For me, the most intriguing part was that, indeed, it started with investigating this space. And then, at one point, I was like, I need to investigate it by putting myself in the field.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  And by actually visiting all these locations that I researched and just go there and analyze and explore whatever is going on there because I never had that experience. I'm not sure about you, but I never had the experience of working eight hours. That's a normal workday for us here…to explore eight hours of work behind the desk every five days of the week.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  So I started taking it off like that, and then it immediately occurred to me that people - the first thing they do when they arrive in the office space is take a seat. And the last thing they do is also take a seat most of the time behind a certain type of screen. And yeah, that got to me. And it was really striking to me that people were actually able to do so, to be honest.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  So the beauty of this piece is that…I'll take a big step…is that at that moment I started to focus on the performative way of doing research. [It’s] how I still do it, developing, designing certain performance experiments for myself to try out myself on location in different spaces and then afterwards, integrate those experiences and those moments of feedback or those reactions or those energies you can get sometimes with just people passing by or whatever also being present in the space. And then continuing with the funneling down process, et cetera, until you get a moment of “Ah, this is something interesting!” And that's when indeed after a year or so…a year and a half of research, I finally got to this point of Reframing Conventions and being able to launch it as a piece.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  So I performed this piece immediately quite a lot of times after 2013, after launching it in Italy, a lot of times. And well, it went quite well. And then at one point, obviously other things happen and also you lose your own interest in a way… [It] shouldn't become automatic for me at least. And then in 2020, I just was in lockdown as [was] half of the world at one point.
</div>

<div class="guest">
  I started to really come down to my core of why I did what I do. And then it occurred to me like, ah, this could be so interesting to relaunch now. Or at least, I started to not even think about relaunching immediately. I just figured, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to do just the same time-lapse I did in 2013."
