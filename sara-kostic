<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Welcome to Open Studios, a podcast brought to you by PerformVu, the digital home for experimental performance. My name is Asia Stewart. I'm a performance artist and the Founding Artistic Director of PerformVu. I'll also be your host. In every episode, I'll be sitting down with a different artist to take a virtual step inside their studio to learn a little bit more about their practice and motivations.</p>
  <p>And in this episode, I am delighted to be speaking with Sara Kostic. Sara Kostic is an interdisciplinary artist who works across performance, dance, visual art, and architecture. Born in Belgrade, Serbia, and now based in New York City, Sara has performed internationally at the Mardin Biennial in Turkey, Venice International Performance Art Week in Italy, and Grace Exhibition Space in New York, among many others.</p>
  <p>Sara is especially interested in the way that bodies take up space and negotiate interactions with borders and limits. Her performances, often site-specific and durational in nature, explore the ways that bodies perceive time and respond to local environments. Welcome to the Open Studios Podcast Sara! And how are you doing today? How are you feeling?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: Good. Thank you for having me. Thank you for a wonderful introduction.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: My first question for you…Could you walk us through the path that you've forged for yourself as an artist, particularly because it's one that's quite interdisciplinary in nature and one that connects or traces these linkages between dance and architecture and performance and movement? What has your personal journey been like?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: Yes, of course. So, I was involved in different types of dance throughout my whole life. And then I started studying architecture. And of course, doing both things was impossible in a way, time wise. And already I was stepping out from dance in general. And then finishing architecture, I was looking into something else, and I discovered performance art as an amazing medium.</p>
  <p>A lot of my art is site-specific. Even when I don't think about it, they definitely were driven by space and how the space itself formed the image of the performance. It kind of shapes the concept. So I’m definitely influenced a lot by architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Now that you work professionally as an architect, how does the mindset that you've developed, how does that influence the way that you design or shape or even begin to plan the performance?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: We tend, you know, with all the things that are constantly present, sometimes we forget about how much influence they have on our lives. And I think architecture can be similar in that sense. In terms of shaping the performance, every space has a history. Every space has a story that definitely layers the concept and the message you want to tell.</p>
  <p>And I think it's something very important to be aware of also when you're doing performance, especially outside, using the city as a playground in a way. In that sense, where are you doing it? What does it mean? It's a very important additional narration to the piece itself. And me working as an architect, it's also interesting to observe what's actually happening with the spaces in terms of the social structures that are occurring.</p>
  <p>So architecture always goes hand in hand historically with the social and economical structures that are currently dominating. They are shaping the spaces we are living in. That very much influences the performance itself as well, because a lot of our pieces are based on social problems. Some of them are more towards activism as well. And in that sense, it's very important to examine the architecture that's around you.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And I'm thinking of one of your performances, like for example, “Sweet Tears,” which you performed at Grace Exhibition Space. In developing this work, how do you approach the research process or familiarizing yourself with the environment, with the space, with its history? What did that look like for that particular work?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: Grace Exhibition Space, it's an amazing space for performance art– whoever doesn't know, should go definitely. I've been in the community for a while now, more than 10 years. And that space in particular, the space inside, has a kind of white box aesthetic and shape. So those kinds of spaces tend to be easier to manage. In a sense, you can steer them down your narrative the way you would like.</p>
  <p>This one, “Sweet Tears,” was based on what I want to say regarding a woman's body. The concept went more from that and then adjusting the scene to the space that I can kind of drive narrative.</p>
  <p>A few different methodologies that I use when I do performance: one can be really like, based on a space– there's a space in Belgrade, Serbia, that used to be one of the first cinemas. It was abandoned for many years, just deteriorating. And those kinds of spaces have a bigger story to tell in that sense, and definitely shape the performance you would do there.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Really fascinating. I also know that a lot of your work, a lot of your performances are very durational in nature and can span multiple hours or days. And I remember in a conversation probably a few weeks ago, you said that you wouldn't qualify a performance as durational if it wasn't, you know, longer than at least like three hours or so. So you're very accustomed to performing for very long periods of time.</p>
  <p>Why do you think that durational performance has become so integral to your practice or the way that you perform and how have you adapted your body to the demands of performing for that long of a period of time?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: So for me, like how I discovered performance actually was through a workshop in Belgrade in 2015. It was Marta Jovanović, she’s a performance artist from Serbia; it was her workshop. What we did there was, right away we had to make a piece that would last for three hours. And it was my first close introduction to performance art practices. And for me it was very challenging. And that was the first thing that I liked: this is hard. It's really hard. But it's very rewarding, transformative, and there is a big story to tell.</p>
  <p>There are a few reasons why I went more for durational pieces. And generally my aesthetic is more minimal. So I like things that develop kind of naturally through time. Making the concept as clear as possible, as minimal as possible, and making it develop through time was my test to see how I'm going to negotiate limits that I thought were appropriate for my work.</p>
</div>

<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: It's really interesting when time becomes almost a material that's part of the development of the performance or of a piece or of an action. Sometimes when I've done longer performances, my sense of time becomes warped and I no longer understand how much time has passed, but I am so much more conscious of the actions that I'm doing and my own physical presence in space.</p>
  <p>When you've done multi-day performances, how has your own perception of time or even perception of yourself, of the spaces where your body begins and ends, how has that become maybe distorted even over time?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: I would say every time we start doing something very durational, there's always a few crises.</p>
  <p>If it's 24 hours, like in the first few hours. So, still sort of in the beginning of the performance. And I think at some point, you finally switch, as you said. Like, you go through some discomfort, definitely. It has to be some sort of meditative state. And [in] that sense, meditation practice really helps me for this kind of performance.</p>
  <p>And then perception of self starts also losing the same meaning that it has in our day to day life. You become one with the action or the piece, or you hear more of the sounds, but still they are not really influencing you, even though you hear them better. So it's kind of creating your own bubble of presence.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: You put that really, really nicely. Another question I have is just about another element or material that I've seen appear in some of your past performances and past works, which is sugar. What has been the significance of sugar as an object or material that you've used in performances and how do you explain your connection to it?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: I started using it very early on. Of course, sugar has a big history as well, but for what I was exploring at that moment it was a very good metaphor for today's society in the sense of consumerism. So the first performance was called “Comfort” and it's definitely that, you know, like you're rewarding yourself with sugar.</p>
  <p>It's super addictive. Many people don't know that. It's there, you want it and then it dissolves fast and you want it more. So the first performance I used it in was called “Comfort” and it was making a mattress out of the sugar. I had like 250 pounds of sugar in the gallery.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: When I think about some of your more recent performances, like “Sweet Tears” or “Body Prayers,” where sugar is a central element or material in those works– I think there's something about sugar... When I think of sugar, I think of the idea of someone saying, “oh, give me some sugar.” Like, give me a kiss. And the way that women's bodies are sometimes sexualized in relation to sugar or being another thing that is consumed. It's interesting to see the connection or trajectory from that first work, from “Comfort” to those pieces.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: And you would call somebody sweetheart and you would tell girls to be sweet. You know, like some sort of social obedience as well that's involved there. And it's connected to being sweet, being nice, being proper.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: And then in your performance of “Sweet Tears,” you have a large pile of sugar in that performance, and you're almost like burying your head or your face in that pile. And then you later go to a second site in the space and you start to pluck your eyelashes or pull out like a single eyelash and you place it into a capsule and then I think you repeated that cycle again.</p>
  <p>What was that specific action that you were doing with your eyelashes and were you also thinking about the existence of beauty culture and the way that we try to almost augment or present our bodies as being sweeter, as being more desirable, as being more likely to be consumed or easily digested?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: It’s exactly that [laughs]. It's exactly that. I think there's still a lot of pressure on beauty standards and I think it's something that should still be addressed a lot. It's how much time we spend thinking about appearance, some aesthetic procedures that are more and more common.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: When I’ve seen documentation of “Sweet Tears,” I always have this visceral reaction when I watch you pluck out one of her eyelashes.</p>
  <p>And so originally, when I was thinking about our conversation today, I was going to ask you a question about pain and how you prepare yourself, how you prepare your body for performances that involve painful aspects or that involve a relatively large amount of discomfort.</p>
  <p>But then just in our conversation, thinking about beauty standards and the work that we do to try to uphold or achieve or attain or come close to the standards that are often unattainable–  I'm thinking about the pain that's attached to a lot of those processes of waxing, of plucking, of cutting, of stripping, of all of those actions that are actually quite painful for the body to experience. And so I guess in many ways in your performance of “Sweet Tears,” you're just highlighting and focusing intently on that aspect too.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: Yeah, because I was thinking like, if I would just pluck my eyebrows, everybody would be like, “oh, well we do that every day.” So I'm just putting it in some other context.</p>
  <p>In terms of preparation, some things are better not to try earlier. Like in the eyelashes, I tried. I just wanted to see if it's easy at all, like how much I have to pull– I did not do too much. But the problem there was having all the sugar, it started to sting a bit because it was going into my pores. But because that was not a long durational piece, it was twenty five minutes, maybe? It's definitely easier to handle.</p>
  <p>And then with long durational ones, small things you would never think of become uncomfortable. Just staying in the same space for hours, or in the same pose with your body, is a completely different discomfort and it's not as obvious as plucking the eyelashes, but it's actually much harder to sustain.</p>
  <p>The one thing that repeatedly caused me a lot of problems would be the cold. Like, in long durational pieces. So I'm doing something else. And you would never think that this is the part of the problem, but that could be it. So you have to be prepared for those kinds of things.</p>
  <p>I did one performance in Venice. It was December [in] an old palace. No heating. So I think for all of us doing performances there, that was that additional layer of difficulty. But then you see what you can do. Like, I was lying on the floor so I thought okay, I will use heating patches. Still not super comfortable, but it helps.</p>
  <p>I would say, meditation really helps a lot. Just, like, calming your thoughts, get out of the panic mode. Being able to calm yourself without really changing the direction of what you're doing is a big asset.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I’m wondering, would do you feel comfortable sharing some of the new works or projects that you're currently developing? I know that you recently received some support from the Brooklyn Arts Council for a work called “Ebb and Flow 2,” and I know you were also very recently named a new Franklin Furnace Fund winner! And congratulations for both of those things. But yeah, I'd love to hear anything that you currently have in your mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: “Ebb and Flow” is the concept I developed with Arantxa. Did you do the podcast with her?</p>
  <p>Asia Stewart: I'm speaking with Arantxa in a few weeks, towards the end of the month.</p>
  <p>Sara Kostic: Whoever's listening to this should go and look at her performances. She is an amazing artist.</p>
  <p>So it's a concept we started developing last year and it's kind of a connection of things that both of us already separately worked on. You will hear she works a lot with lights and also ecological questions, environmental questions. And I also worked a lot with water prior. So we kind of started thinking about how to do installation together. And we will do the new one, hopefully, in November. We'll see. Still figuring out the dates.</p>
  <p>Generally it's more focused on water. The issue of water is something that I started thinking of since 2017 I would say. Those kinds of performance[s] can also be site-specific, but I think the installation we were working on, it's more like our own influence on things. So we are definitely– with our movement and bodies– influencing the installation itself and changing it. So that's a big focus of the installation is water.</p>
  <p>Also, there's some new stuff. I'm not gonna say a lot [laughs]. You should come and see it. But that's one of the concepts. A lot of my architectural projects were regarding water, food accessibility, especially in the city. So some of the thoughts for me are coming definitely from that area about architecture and how the cities are developed and the future of the city.</p>
  <p>And then I'm still working on a video for this year's Performance Art Week in Venice in December, and I'm really looking forward to going. They're gonna be focused more also on video works. I'm really looking forward to seeing everybody there after these few years. So that's the one piece, and I started to focus on some new things there. I started thinking a lot about how much we are getting overwhelmed with everything that's on our phones– from social media to apps and how sometimes that really starts influencing the way we are living. It becomes like the sort of food and obligation and source of anxiety and everything all together. So I started exploring some of that for a new piece.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: It'll be really exciting to see how you choose to almost embody and replicate that, that sense of anxiety and that overwhelming sensation. I think of it almost like a deluge or a flood when you go on social media and you go on, I don't know, TikTok or Instagram. It’s almost a paradox. You have the ability to be so connected to so many people at once, and yet there's something quite isolating about being online, being plugged in.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: Yeah, that's something that I started exploring. We'll see where it leads. And then for Franklin Furnace, I have a new piece with sugar that I've been developing for quite some time now, and I'm really looking forward to showing it with this grant.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: I'm very, very excited to watch everything [laughs]. Please keep me in the loop and I will definitely be in the audience.</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: Yes, definitely.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Well, Sara, is there anything else that we haven't touched on that you would like to share before we close?</p>
</div>
<div class="guest">
  <p>Sara Kostic: I don't think so. We touched a lot of topics. Thank you so much. I want to say that you and Indy were amazing with the platform and the whole support, so. Thank you.</p>
</div>
<div class="host">
  <p>Asia Stewart: Thank you, and enjoy the rest of your vacation. We didn't mention that you're currently in Portugal, so I hope you have a magical rest of your week, and thanks for coming on the podcast.</p>
