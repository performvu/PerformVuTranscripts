<div class="host">Asia Stewart: Welcome to Open Studios, a podcast brought to you by PerformVu, the digital home for experimental performance. My name is Asia Stewart. I'm a performance artist and the founding artistic director of PerformVu, and I'll also be your host. Every episode, I'll be sitting down with a different artist to take a virtual step inside their studio to learn more about their practice and motivations.</div>

<div class="host">Asia Stewart: This episode is going to be slightly different. I'm joined by Indy Sanders and they are the founder of PerformVu. Welcome, Indy. Hello!</div>
